# CoderDojo-Python
Python module for CoderDojo

## What can I do with Python?
All sorts of things really:

* Draw, manipulate pictures, sounds, texts...
* Make little games
* Build backend for web stuff
etc.

## Instructions:

(trinket is using Python 2, but if you want to do your own stuff, feel free to download version 3)

## Pre-requisite
None, but hopefully you've learned a little bit of maths / geometry, just a little bit.
